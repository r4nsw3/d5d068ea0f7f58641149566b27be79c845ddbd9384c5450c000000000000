  |   Sparklite is an action-adventure set in the whimsical and             |
  |   ever-changing land of Geodia. Battle foes in top-down action using    |
  |   an arsenal of gadgets, guns, and gear. Explore dangerous corners of   |
  |   the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining      |
  |   industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Everything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite...    |
  |   it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned   |
  |   how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed      |
  |   providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those       |
  |   brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power       |
  |   with grave consequences. Geodia's self-titled "Baron" has devised a   |
  |   plot to mine the world's Sparklite core to meet his own ends.         |
  |   Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore    |
  |   to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the         |
  |   consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned       |
  |   into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite    |
  |   core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges     |
  |   the world, setting back the Baron's efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must   |
  |   stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to    |
  |   create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky           |
  |   mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the   |
  |   Baron's henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work    |
  |   with Geodia's weird and wonderful inhabitants if she's to face the    |
  |   Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it's too late.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Our hero, Ada, must travel to each zone of the world to shut down     |
  |   the Baron's Digsites before it's too late...                          |
